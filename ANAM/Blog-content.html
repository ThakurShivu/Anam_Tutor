                            <p>Exam time is always stressful. Reading piles of books and memorizing
                                everything can be a very difficult task. The majority of students
                                fail to complete their syllabus on the right time. If you deal with
                                the same issue, we have some help in hand.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>It is impossible to add more hours to your day but it is surely
                                possible to make every hour more efficient and productive. In this
                                article, we will tell you some of the easiest and more efficient
                                ways to study more in less time.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>&nbsp;Using these tips, you would definitely be able to cover your
                                entire syllabus while also getting sufficient time to revise what
                                you have learned. If you don’t believe us, read further:</p>
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Study the same thing at different locations</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>
                            <p>Now, this is a scientifically proven fact- if you study the same
                                information at different locations, your brain retains information
                                better. Studies say that when we study at a particular location, our
                                brain tends to link the memorized content to the surrounding.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>So, if you get many facts to link to one or the other thing related
                                to the different surroundings, it gets easier for the brain to
                                recall it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>So, study in your room, garden, balcony, at a friend’s place, and
                                coffee shop. This will help you recall it better once you sit in
                                your exam hall.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <div>
                            <p>If you keep your laptops, novels, smartphones, etc on your study
                                table, you are surely going to get distracted. You may feel an urge
                                to just give 5 minutes to check the Instagram feed and those 5
                                minutes will miraculously turn into 30 minutes before you would
                                realize that you have wasted a lot of time.

                        <p></p>
                        <p>A tutor not just helps the student to study his syllabus but also offers
                            moral support. He works towards building confidence in a student and
                            helps him to achieve his life goals.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>But not every tutor displays the virtues required to be a
                            good teacher. There are some teachers who aim to make money out of their
                            teaching job unconcerned whether the students are benefiting from their
                            coaching or not.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>If you do not want a tutor who cares less about students,
                            you must read about the virtues of a good tutor.
                            <br><br>&nbsp;<br>
                            <b>Here are the qualities of a good tutor:</b>

                        </ul>
                        <p>&nbsp;<br>A good tutor helps in instilling confidence in his students. He
                            is aware of the fact that in certain situations or upon seeing one
                            failure, the confidence of any student begins to leave its roots. He
                            keeps his students’ confidence firm and helps them to understand that
                            success and failures are a part of life.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>He helps his students to inculcate confidence and prepare
                            for the tough challenges ahead.<br>&nbsp;

                        </ul>
                        <p>&nbsp;<br>Every student is different and every need is different. A good
                            tutor adapts himself to the tailored needs of his students. He is not
                            stern or sick to the old rules of pedagogy.
                            students that help them derive the maximum benefit. He understands the
                            goals and aspirations of his students and adopts an approach that helps
                            them to achieve their goals.

                        <p>&nbsp;<br>A good tutor is someone who is always in the easy reach of his
                            students. He is always accessible and helps the students whenever they
                            need him.<br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Whether the students want help with the syllabus or need guidance in
                            defining a career path, whether the students want to seek emotional
                            support or look for someone to help them cope in the immense competitive
                            world; a good tutor always stays at the reach of the students.<br>&nbsp;

                        </ul>
                        <p>&nbsp;<br>Teaching is a serious job but when some fun and enthusiasm is
                            injected in the approach, the process becomes more productive. Positive
                            energy benefits both the ends of the spectrum.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>A tutor full of energy, confidence, and positive attitude
                            always succeed in bringing the best out of the students. Tutor’s
                            positive energy impacts the students in amazing ways.
                            <br>&nbsp;<br>A teacher who motivates their students with a positive
                            approach is indeed the best tutor.<br>&nbsp;

                        <p>&nbsp;<br>The ideal relationship between a tutor and a student is one in
                            which the student can discuss all his problems with the teacher without
                            any hesitation. Apart from the syllabus, a student should be able to

                            A good tutor is a good listener and helps his students to face their

                                <p></p>
                                <p>Meet ploonets: planets of moonish origin.</p>
                                <p>In other star systems, some moons could escape their planets and start
                                    orbiting their stars instead, new simulations suggest. Scientists have
                                    dubbed such liberated worlds “ploonets,” and say that current telescopes
                                    may be able to find the wayward objects.</p>
                                <p>Astronomers think that exomoons — moons orbiting planets that orbit
                                    stars other than the sun&nbsp; — should be common, but&nbsp;
                                    <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skepticism-whether-first-known-exomoon-exists-kepler"

                                        them have turned up empty so far</a>
                                    &nbsp;("<em>SN Online: 4/30/19</em>"). Astrophysicist Mario Sucerquia
                                    of the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia and colleagues
                                    simulated what would happen to those moons if they orbited&nbsp;

                                        style="color: #c64308; text-decoration-line: none;">hot Jupiters</a>
                                    , gas giants that lie scorchingly close to their stars ("<em>SN:
                                        7/8/17, p. 4</em>"). Many astronomers think that hot Jupiters
                                    weren’t born so close, but instead migrated toward their star from a
                                    more distant orbit.
                                </p>
                                <p>As the gas giant migrates, the combined gravitational forces of the
                                    planet and the star would inject extra energy into the moon’s
                                    orbit,&nbsp;
                                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11400.pdf" target="_blank"

                                        escapes"</a>
                                    , the researchers report June 29 at arXiv.org.
                                </p>
                                <p>“This process should happen in every planetary system composed of a
                                    giant planet in a very close-in orbit,” Sucerquia says. “So ploonets
                                    should be very frequent.”</p>
                                <p>Some ploonets may be indistinguishable from ordinary planets. Others,
                                    whose orbits keep them close to their planet, could reveal their
                                    presence by changing the timing of when their neighbor planet crosses,
                                    or transits, in front of the star. The ploonet should stay close enough
                                    to the planet that its gravity can speed or slow the planet’s transit
                                    times. Those deviations should be detectable by combining data from
                                    planet-hunting telescopes like NASA’s TESS or the now-defunct Kepler,
                                    Sucerquia says.</p>
                                <p>Ploonethood may be a relatively short-lived phenomenon, though, making
                                    the worlds more difficult to spot. About half of the ploonets in the
                                    researchers’ simulations crashed into either their planet or star within
                                    about half a million years. And half of the remaining survivors crashed
                                    within a million years.</p>
                                <p>Even with few visible survivors, ploonets could help explain some
                                    bizarre exoplanetary features. Moon debris from such crashes could lead
                                    to&nbsp;
                                    <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-rings-encircle-young-exoplanet"
                                        style="color: #c64308; text-decoration-line: none;">giant ring
                                        systems around planets</a>
                                    , like the 37 rings that encircle exoplanet J1407b, the team says
                                </p>
                                <p>Or, if the ploonet had an icy surface or an atmosphere before moving
                                    close to its star, the star’s heat would evaporate it, giving the
                                    ploonet a tail like a comet’s. Evaporating ploonets zipping by with a
                                    long light-blocking tail could explain&nbsp;

                                        style="color: #c64308; text-decoration-line: none;">strangely
                                        flickering stars like Tabby’s star</a>
                                    , Sucerquia says ("<em>SN: 12/22/18, p. 9</em>").
                                </p>
                                <p>“Those structures [rings and flickers] have been discovered, have been
                                    observed,” Sucerquia says. “We just propose a natural mechanism to
                                    explain [them].”</p>
                                <p>While the solar system doesn’t have any hot Jupiters, ploonethood may be
                                    possible here, too. Earth’s moon is moving slowly away from the Earth,
                                    at a rate of about 4 centimeters per year. When it eventually breaks
                                    free, “the moon is a potential ploonet,” Sucerquia says — although that
                                    won’t happen for about 5 billion years.</p>
                                <p>The study is a good first step for thinking about what would happen to
                                    exomoons in real planetary systems, says planetary astrophysicist
                                    Natalie Hinkel of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, who
                                    wasn’t involved in the new work. “Nobody’s looked at the problem quite
                                    like this,” she says. “It adds to the layers of how complex these
                                    systems are.”</p>
                                <p>Plus, ploonet is “a wonderful name,” Hinkel says. “Normally I sort of
                                    eye-roll at these made-up names, but this one is a keeper.”</p>

                                <p>1. In case you have studied from the NCERT book before (may be for school
                                    exam/pre board exam) then you just need to do a quick revision of the
                                    topics and then solve the NCERT problems in the text questions and then,
                                    the exercises.</p>
                                <p>2. In case you have not studied the NCERT book before, then you must
                                    revise important topics as listed in&nbsp;
                                    <strong>Learning Objective'</strong>&nbsp;in the beginning of each
                                    chapter and then solve NCERT problems.
                                </p>
                                <p>3. Write the important formulae on a sheet and revise it daily.</p>
                                <p><strong>Organic Chemistry</strong></p>
                                <p>1. This is a scoring section but requires systematic revision. Typically,
                                    the types of questions asked are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Conceptual questions (reasoning based)</li>
                                    <li>Conversions/Word Problem</li>
                                    <li>Name Reactions</li>
                                    <li>Distinction Test</li>
                                    <li>Mechanism of reaction(as per NCERT)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>2. A lot of practice is needed so try to solve as many questions as you
                                    can on a daily basis.</p>
                                <p>3. Don’t just read; write the solution yourself several times to develop
                                    that flow and gain speed and accuracy. Remember, balancing of reaction
                                    is not needed.</p>
                                <p>4. Most of the students ignore and/or do not revise certain chapters
                                    like&nbsp;
                                    <strong>Polymers</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bio-molecular</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
                                    <strong>Chemistry is everyday life</strong>
                                    But these chapters collectively carry a weightage of 10 marks and hence,
                                    one must devote some time to revise them.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Inorganic Chemistry</strong></p>
                                <p>1. In this section, questions asked are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reasoning-based</li>

                                </p>

                                <div><span>A huge positive gained from private tuition is the amount of time
                                        a student will receive from a teacher.&nbsp;It’s quite impossible
                                        for teachers to attend to every student, which results in your child
                                        not understanding a lesson acutely.&nbsp; As private tuition is
                                        usually on a one-to-one basis, teachers can focus their attention
                                        fully on a student.&nbsp; This is obviously a huge advantage
                                        compared classes of twenty to thirty pupils where a teacher’s time
                                        is divided and individuals can very easily become lost in the
                                        crowd.&nbsp; With less distractions, the tutor is better able to
                                        appreciate and work on a student’s weak points, making the whole
                                        learning process more effective.

                                        at the earliest. The word international implies global integration
                                        of art, culture, curricula, ideas, identity and their amalgamation
                                         through practice. It’s really funny to see many international
                                        schools holding numerous international flags around their campus but
                                         they are rigid in their identity and violent nationalists. Our
                                        school follows secularist prayers in the morning assembly. Our kids
                                         learn, practice and imbibe festivals from across the globe. We
                                        cherish a dream to have many foreign faces with us to imply our
                                         existence. Further we plan to introduce IGCSE & IB diploma
                                        programmes to give the freedom of choice on their curricula. All

                                     vigorous mind can only be the best in education. At the same time,
                                    sports are also important means of entertainment after long hours of

                                 <div>Childhood is a time for exploring opportunities. Today's youth has many

                                     child but tapping them at the right stage is very important. A child may
                                     have an unexpressed potential in becoming a dancer, sports person or a
                                     performer. For the same, parents must give them the right exposure to

                                     express their talent.</div>

                                     joys and laughter. Sports teach them that it is courage and endurance to
                                     face the trials, hardships and various rigidities of daily life.
                                     Students learn to do no underhand dealings and not hobbling. Sports are
                                     another name of uprightness, integrity and devotion for students. Thus a
                                     good sportsman can be the ideal citizen of the kingdom.</div>
